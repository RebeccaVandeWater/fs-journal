#SECTION - Variables

- To create a group of variables (such as on colors) - 
    root:{
    --COLORNAME: #HEXCODE;
    --COLORNAME: #HEXCODE;
    }

    - Now you can insert the variables into something like a CSS selector if you wish. This makes it much easier to type out and setting out themes that you can change quickly. 
    - It isn't recommended to use it if you're only going to use it once, as it would be redundant.
