# Git

Testing Git Push


#NOTE - Getting Started at CodeWorks:

- Every wk journals are graded on Friday morning.
    - Every 2 journals missed is a strike **do the readings**

- No matter the checkpoint, you may only miss 2 requirements. You can make them up if you meet certain requirements.

- During checkpoints **get the requirements done first**. Complete small passes to get the requirements done, then go through as many more times as needed to make it look nice and polished. Get the skeleton done first, always!!



#TODO - Important Dates:

- Holiday Closure - 7/3 - 7/7, all of the week of the 4th of July.
- Invoices for tuition will go out this Friday (Week of 6/5)
