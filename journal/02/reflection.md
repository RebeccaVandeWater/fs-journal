# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Operations with numbers was mixed, but I learned a lot about how to draw numbers to the screen without exponentially increasing them.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? There are so many things about javascript that I don't know! I also need to research more about javascript functions.
- What are you struggling with? Some javascript functions, particularly ones that call id's, have been challenging for me. I am unsure of how to streamline the ones that are using the same code but calling different id's. 
- What would you count as a victory? My website worked!
