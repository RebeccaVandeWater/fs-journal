# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Git allows you to put your data in the cloud so that you or your team can use it later. This is useful when using different devices or working remotely. Your team also needs access to the code you are all working on!

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Make Directory

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | ANSWER HERE |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is the order that your code is read and implemented. Code with a higher specificity score will be used over code that is lower. Classes are more specific than elements, so those properties will be implemented over element properties.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Everything will have the highest possible specificity and some rules will likely not be implemented the way that you want them to. 

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Selector, property, and value. The selector is what element we want to style, the property is the style we want to apply, and the value is the specific amount of the style such as hexcode for color, pixels for height, etc.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | ANSWER HERE |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | ANSWER HERE |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Flex moves elements in a section around each other relative to each other and the box that they are in.
