# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> |Inheritance is where a child class will take on one or more properties from a parent class. One example we have use frequently is when we write a new controller in the backend, we will write "extends BaseController". This allows our new controller to inherit important features already written in the BaseController, like this.router.

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> The Singleton design pattern creates one instance of a class that can be accessed globally. One of the benefits of this is that this singleton allows static copies to be created of it, without overwriting the original code.

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The observer design pattern assigns listeners onto objects. Those listeners "watch" the object for any changes to it. Then, they will "notify" anything that needs to change when that object changes. There are many ways to assign listeners, app.on/app.emit, ref, and computed are just a few.

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> The Strategy design pattern is used to create new routes when one doesn't work or fit the section it is on. It also allows you to isolate code from other algorithms.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> The Factory design pattern works quite a bit around inheritance, and allows support for it. As in inheritance, it allows you to create new instances of a class that will inherit the important methods from the original class, without muddling your code.

06. What is test driven development?

> Test driven development is where a development team codes small and tests small before moving on to write new code. The idea is to ensure that a specific piece of code works as intended without bugs before adding on to it. One example would be testing logging in, then resetting passwords, and then account verification. By ensuring that the first feature works correctly, the other features will then work better and have a good foundation to be built off of.

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> DoD is the Definition of Done. This is the level of functionality and debugging that is supposed to have occurred before handing a feature back to the client.

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> As a user, I can edit my account from my account page.
> As a user, I can navigate to an "About" page.

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> During the Sprint Planning ceremony, tasks are moved from a Product Backlog into a Sprint Backlog. These are the tasks that the development team aims to complete (DoD) by the end of a specified time frame.

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> The Daily Standup is typically the ceremony in which a Task is assigned to a developer. They will first show what they were able to complete the day prior, get assigned a new task, and then identify anything that might be blocking them from completing that task.
